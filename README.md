# installs
Installs database for tracking install dates and network data

I created this Web App to make tracking and booking printer/photocopier installations alot easier

Written in PHP in 2015/2016 as I was learning PHP, please don't judge.
The code is messy and the comments are sparse.
I have made some minor adhoc changes over the years, but I havent found the time to clean up the code.

This is a legacy app I don't plan on updating and I'm in the process of rewriting a new app with React and NodeJS.
